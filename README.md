# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to employ unsupervised machine learning strategies to a cryptocurrency dataset. The senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting (an investment bank), is interested in providing customers with an investment portfolio which includes cryptocurrencies. Due to the abundance and diversity of cryptocurrency options, a grouping/classification system is needed to make these investment portfolios possible. Since it is not known how these cryptocurrencies should be grouped together, the use of unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms is an appropriate tool. This project involves data preprocessing, dimension reduction using PCA, cryptocurrency clustering using K-means, and data visualizations.
